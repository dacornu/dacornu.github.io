# Why this guide #
 <img src="p4vasp_small.png" alt="Logo" width="100">

P4Vasp is one of the Graphical User Interface to visualise spacial arrangements of atoms from their geometrical coordinates. Using directly the output files generated by the first principle modelling package VASP, this software is rather popular. Unfortunately, the documentation about this software is very limited [on the webpage of the creators](http://p4vasp.at/index.php/documentation). 

Based on my own use of this software, I want to make a small unofficial documentation.

# Some known issues #

## Presence of a .xml files in the current folder directory ##

By default, p4vasp will look for .xml files when it starts, for instance vasprun.xml files that will be automatically read.

If your current folder directory contains .xml files not related to Vasp, it may generate various error messages. Remove those files and it should behave better.

# Rotate around one bond with p4vasp #

Rotation around the axe of a bond.

It is possible to perform a rotation around the axe of a bond with p4vasp which preserve all the lengths for the bonds within the molecules. It can be realized in several steps.

1. Open the file containing the geometrical informations.
2. Visualize it with the "Show" icon.
3. Select, within the "Edit" menu, "Rotate atoms"

4. Select the atom that will remain fixed during the rotation. Here, the carbon on the right side of the but-1-ene adsorbed molecule.

The selection is rather tricky in p4vasp. You have two possibilities: if you know the orders of your atomes in your input files, you can type it directly in the "Selection" part. But the simplest way is to use the graphical representation and press the space bar on the keyboard when the cursor is over the atom you want to select.

Once the atoms are selected, they appear striped.

5. Select then the other atoms. Here, a methyl group of an adsorbed alkene is selected.

6. Once all your atoms are selected, you can click on "Get group". The center (the first atom you selected) and the group selected for rotation appear in the Applet.

7. Then, you have to select the second atom from the bond which define the axis of rotation. Select it as you selected the previous atoms. The axis vector will be computed automatically.

8. The rest is straightforward: by typind and angle and clicking on "rotate", you will generate a rotation of the atoms (here, the three hydrogen atoms selected) around the axe of the C-C bond.
