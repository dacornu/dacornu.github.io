<h1>Scientific tour guide</h1>
The association "<a href="http://www.parcoursdessciences.fr/">Parcours des sciences</a>" (French website) organizes tours in the latin quarter (Paris) about some scientific figures who worked and lived in the neighbourhood.
<br /> With this association, I told the story of the life of Marie Curie to students, university members or others people curious about the history of science.
